### [repl.it](https://replit.com)

My Mac is creaking around the edges and, 
before forking out for a new one, I'd give an 
online IDE a go.

Repl.it seemed like a good start, and I've got some thoughts.

1. I've just been doing ```nodejs/react``` stuff which can be pretty bandwidth intensive.
2. Everything is in the cloud, so ```npm``` hosts are close, and/or it's cached locally.
3. Either way, ```npm instal ___``` is fast.
