### Repl.it

My Mac is creaking around the edges and, 
before forking out for a new one, I'd give an 
online IDE a go.

Repl.it seemed like a good start, and I've got some thoughts.

2. Everything is in the cloud, so ```npm``` hosts are close, and/or it's cached locally.
3. Either way, install is fast
