I have 30 years of post-graduate experience in Computing Science, with 20 of those years dedicated to Java. Throughout my career, I've gained extensive experience in various technologies and worked in different industries across Australia, the UK, and New Zealand.

In 2016, I faced personal challenges related to becoming a father, battling depression and anxiety, and felt the need for a change. I found that Java was becoming too restrictive and causing more problems than it solved, primarily due to issues with classical inheritance and strong static typing. It became clear to me that these problems could be addressed by other languages, including Python and several newer ones.

I embarked on a learning journey, starting with Groovy, a JVM language, and then delving into JavaScript. To my surprise, my perception of JavaScript as essentially untestable changed dramatically, especially with the advent of Node.js, which transformed the way I viewed the language. Its standardization since ES6 made it my language of choice, despite some lingering issues and questionable design decisions.

I've been part of a couple of startups that didn't progress beyond the prototype stage, leading me to seek opportunities in organizations that offer clear goals and structure. I decided to retool myself in JavaScript and Document Databases (Doc DBs), and I'm absolutely loving it. The tech ecosystem has grown immensely, and the problems and their solutions are more interesting than ever. It's an exciting time to be in the tech industry.

Here are some highlights from my career:

- Oh-Otto: Spent about a year learning JavaScript and related technologies, including NPM and jQuery.

- Optimiser: Joined a startup in London where development remained geographically localized. This experience gave me the chance to learn Python, a language I grew to love.

- CloudScape: Worked with jQuery, React, and CoffeeScript.

- Fairfax: Engaged in a six-month contract in Sydney, initially followed by a three-month remote contract. Unfortunately, the contract ended due to company changes. The company is now ACM and operates as a major Django site.

I've also had shorter stints at various startups:

- Square Peg (3 months): Worked on a platform designed as a meeting place for people with diverse needs, utilizing MongoDB and React.

- Be-Spec (3 months): Developed an Android Kiosk App for Optometrists, enabling clients to take photos of themselves with glasses on and share them with others. This project involved Firebase Firestore and Authentication.

- Paere (2 months): Contributed to a job seeker matching app for the Agriculture sector, connecting temporary workers and travelers with short-term opportunities.
